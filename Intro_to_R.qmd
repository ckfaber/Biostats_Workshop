## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1

# 1.	R/RStudio windows
# 2.	Set working directories: 
# 3.	Some important options: remove, list etc. 
# 4.	Construction of vectors, matrix, and data frames (with “Tibble” format)
# 5.	Import data files (mainly csv and text files)
# 6.	Data investigation: str, dim, name, etc
# 7.	Data management using “dplyr” package: filter, arrange, select, mutate functions.

```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
